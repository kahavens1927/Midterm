        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Four generations of the Iaria Family have been serving 
            antipasto, pizza, lasagna, & spaghetti on this corner for over 90 years. <br> Our pizza 
            dough and sauce are still made from scratch. Our meatballs, Italian sausage, tiramisu, 
            roquefort and all sauces are made in house. <br> Our staff is friendly and works hard to make our 
            guests' experience both comfortable & enjoyable. Iaria's is retro to its core. 
            <br> The exterior and interior still have original red & green neon and the walls are lined 
            with celebrities, friends & family.
